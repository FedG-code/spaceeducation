  description: " Fossil Fuels are made from the remains of organisms that lived long
    long longago. . .  they are finite (which means they won\u2019t last forever)
    so they need to be used wisely.They cannot be produced by humans and have to
    be found.  We are essentially using oldremains cooked in bacteria (Oil and gas)
    or plants that did not decompose correctly (coal) tomake the world run.  This
    includes fuel for our spaceship."
