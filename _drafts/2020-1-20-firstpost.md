## Overview: 
Embedding learning into games is moving to the forefront of education. Is there a way that we can encourage the learning of physics into game that appeals to adults as well as children? For inspiration see [Video Games That Teach You QUANTUM PHYSICS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8iVi8t6Nk)

## Aim:
The group will create a hex tile style strategy game set in space. One the ‘game board’ will be various stellar objects/systems/planets/phenomena resulting in gravity variations, etc. that the player must navigate/use to their advantage. The player will also build a ‘Tech Tree’ to support their game. This function of the game will ask the player to demonstrate their grasp of physics (game sets a problem, asks a question) that the player must then quickly research and respond to in real-life. The correct answer offers a tech boost. The wrong answer may lead to disaster later on in the game (ships explode, get lost, and fail).
