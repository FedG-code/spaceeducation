# Aims for this meeting:

 - Discuss how the resources will be implemented
 - Discuss methods for movement
 - Scenario ideas for interactive planets

# Resources:

 - 4 key resources: Fuel, Food, Metal and Knowledge
 - Building a science lab can increase generation?
 - Collect these resources through interacting with planet tiles and answering questions correctly. Should also generate some food and fuel per turn anyway
 - Certain types of ship improve yield i.e. resource ship so incentive to move through tech tree

# Movement:

 - Starting number of tiles the player is able to move will be decided when we have a completed map as will help pace the early game
 - Will likely use the A^* pathfinding algorithm.
 - Turns will be a method of limiting movement

# Scenarios:

 - Abbie, Safiya and Kresda will continue creating scenarios and questions to accompany them. Abbieâ€™s list of areas to possible focus on will be attached to the minutes
