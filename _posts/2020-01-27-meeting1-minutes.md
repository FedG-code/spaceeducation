<span class="underline">Federico outlines general plan for the game
itself:</span>

<span class="underline">Feasibility:</span> We are working with a
hex-tile turn based game therefore need to remember that we can't
represent complicated physical movement (e.g. elliptical orbits) within
this game

<span class="underline">Fundamental Concepts To Be Included:</span> HP
(could be for both your civ's base and your vehicles), Currency (gained
through encounters and used to progress through the tech tree), attack
power (increased through tech tree and maybe randomly throughout
board?), time constraints (greater rewards the faster a task is
completed), AFK, diplomacy, scientific accuracy, A.I. (2/3 as turn based
and don't want to wait ages for your turn), build additional vehicles to
vary movement distance and direction.

<span class="underline">Problems we need to find solutions to:</span>

<span class="underline">Incorporating physics into the
environment</span>: Don't want to only include physics in the encounter
setting as can get boring with just answering questions that pop up on
the screen. -try and gear the game mechanics towards physics without it
being too complicated. E.g. Power generation

<span class="underline">Diplomacy:</span> Ways to prevent attacks on
your base for a certain number of turns, trade deals , resource sharing

<span class="underline">Encounters - Scenario ideas:</span>

  - > Planet on an orbit that will send them into an non-habitable area.
    > Then can find things for the player to calculate to help change
    > the orbit. Rewards can be currency/ materials and tech tree points

<span class="underline">Question Types:</span>

  - > Want to stick to simple answers so multiple choice, number or
    > short specific answers (1/2 words) so the answer is right or wrong
    > no grey area to code in.

  - > Harder questions for more important/ significant advancements?

  - > Each planet/ area can focus on a specific area of physics/
    > equation. E.g. Lagrange points

<span class="underline">Complexity (the enemy of feasibility):</span>

Have options at the beginning for what type of civilisation you want to
play as. Each type has different traits, therefore you get buffs
specific to the chosen civ to give it some variety. Can lead to
alliances, trade deals etc.

<span class="underline">Plan Of Action:</span>

  - > Everyone download UNITY

  - > Come up with possible scenarios

  - > Consult with professors

  - > Materials

  - > Adaptable questions that can be aimed to multiple age groups and
    > possible to represent in game
