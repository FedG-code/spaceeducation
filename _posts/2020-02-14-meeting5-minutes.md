Meeting 5 Minutes: 14th February 2020 GO Jones Room 410
Apologies: None
```

# Aims for this meeting:

 - Outline a full progress update
 - Discuss exactly what is feasible and so what will be focused on in the coming weeks
 - Create a master to do list 

# Progress Update: Fed

 - Map generation not working correctly but progressing through Quill tutorials
 - There is a lot of confusion when it comes to the code in its current state as multiple people have been working on the same section. There are some difficulties when trying to debug. This method of working through a couple of tutorials then passing onto the next person isnâ€™t working. Therefore we need one person to work on a section to completion. Fed = Map
 - Need to create a new folder and bring over only working code. This includes removing the mini map for the time being.

# Realisticallly what is feasible?: Fed, Sam, Ben

 - A randomly generating map,
 - Turn based
 - Limitations on movement and opportunities to improve this throughout
 - A victory condition (tech tree completion?)
 - Simple damage
 - Resources to collect and use

# How do we implement resource gathering?: Ben

 - This can be modeled on CIV. Ben will research and implement this

# Creating the master to do list : Abbie

Reasoning: Rather than having to explicitly assign tasks on a weekly basis during meetings it would be much easier to have a shared place where everyone can see a list of everything that needs to be done and can pick up tasks as and when this is required.

 - Using trello as can create seperate to do lists for code, research, admin
