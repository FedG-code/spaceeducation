<span class="underline">Things we have encountered since last
meeting:</span>

  - > Can we incorporate satellites? Would have to be stationary as
    > cannot properly depict orbits with this hex-tile format

  - > Consider resource gathering depending on how many planets have
    > been overtaken

  - > Marking of territory and rewarding you for interactions with new
    > territory

  - > Concerns about being able to utilise the AI Watson adequately

  - > Going to have to compromise on complexity for the sake of ensuring
    > we have a complete and playable game at the end

<span class="underline">More info from Jon:</span> Licencing and art:
Can pretty much use anything that is freely available unless it says
specifically that we can’t as we aren’t going to be actually publishing
the product.

<span class="underline">Using Waston?:</span> Sam has been checking what
Watson outputs. Tests both the example given with the program and a user
submitted twitter profile.

Character types: What is relevant? Should pick some main characters to
choose from if you don’t want to put your own twitter in.

<span class="underline">What would personality impact?:</span> Could
make some choice as to which branch of the tech tree you focus depending
on advantages and boosts due to personality markers.

<span class="underline">Victory conditions:</span> Currently considering
3 victory conditions; tech tree completion and conversion of other
colonies to your civilisation. Could create an end-game branch of tech
tree with more difficult questions. Final possible victory condition
could be exploration based. Include randomly generating tiles that you
can collect which could give you an endgame thing such as a wormhole.
Could maybe collect parts of a formula for something.

<span class="underline">Tech boost opportunities:</span> Building a
science lab could have a question pop up every turn in the late game to
give a tech boost when you get the questions correct.
