## Overview: 
Embedding learning into games is moving to the forefront of education. Is there a way that we can encourage the learning of physics into game that appeals to adults as well as children? For inspiration see https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FWM8iVi8t6Nk%3Ft%3D117&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C6f8859d4bea7463a296108d79a726a7a%7C569df091b01340e386eebd9cb9e25814%7C0%7C0%7C637147688514057286&amp;sdata=%2FvLkhsOJ4YLVrWwSOHwDFx33vp%2Fv2rmX8qNkQ7BVEcY%3D&amp;reserved=0.

## Aim:
The group will create a hex tile style strategy game set in space. One the ‘game board’ will be various stellar objects/systems/planets/phenomena resulting in gravity variations, etc. that the player must navigate/use to their advantage. The player will also build a ‘Tech Tree’ to support their game. This function of the game will ask the player to demonstrate their grasp of physics (game sets a problem, asks a question) that the player must then quickly research and respond to in real-life. The correct answer offers a tech boost. The wrong answer may lead to disaster later on in the game (ships explode, get lost, and fail).
